## Overview
This project is an **interactive data analytics and machine learning dashboard** built with **Streamlit** to explore historical video game sales data.  
It analyzes **genre trends, platform lifecycles, regional preferences**, and includes a **machine learning model** to predict global sales.

The dashboard is designed to support **data-driven insights** into how video game markets evolve over time across genres, platforms, and regions.

## Dataset
The project is based on a cleaned and enriched version of the classic **Video Game Sales dataset**, containing:

- Game metadata (platform, genre, publisher, year)
- Regional sales (NA, EU, JP, Other)
- Engineered features (log-transformed sales, publisher strength, era labels)
- Aggregated and normalized datasets for visualization

Raw data is stored separately from processed analytical datasets to reflect real-world data pipelines.
